# stelscope
A telescope mount control tool. For displaying stars stellarium 0.22.1 code is used. Everything related to gui, translations, scripts, etc is removed from stellarium code. What was left from Stellarium is converted to a shared library only for getting object coordinates/brightness/size from it.
