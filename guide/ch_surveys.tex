\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:surveys:introduction}


A sky survey is a map of the sky stored as a hierarchical set of a potentially
large number of smaller images (called tiles).  The advantage compared to a
regular texture is that we can render only the visible tiles of an image at the
lowest resolution needed.  This is particularly interesting for rendering
online images that can be stored on a server, while the client only has
to download the parts he currently uses.

Since version 0.18.0, Stellarium added some preliminary support for loading and
rendering online surveys in the Hierarchical Progressive Surveys (HiPS) format,
developed by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance.
A full description of the format can be found on the IVOA website:

\section{Hipslist file and default surveys}
\label{sec:surveys:hipslistFile}

Hipslist files are text files used to describe catalogs of HiPS surveys.  The
full specification is part of the HiPS format, and looks like that:

\begin{configfile}
# Example of a hipslist file.
# Date: 2018-03-19

hips_service_url  = https://data.stellarium.org/surveys/callisto
hips_release_date = 2018-03-18T14:01Z
hips_status       = public mirror clonableOnce
\end{configfile}

As of v0.18.0, by default Stellarium tries to load HiPS from two sources:
\url{http://alaskybis.unistra.fr/hipslist} and
\url{https://data.stellarium.org/surveys/hipslist}.

This can be changed with the hips/sources options in the configuration
file.  For example:

\begin{configfile}
[hips]
sources/size = 1
sources/1/url = "https://myownhips/hipslist"

\end{configfile}

\section{Solar system HiPS survey}

Though not specified in the HiPS standard, Stellarium recognises HiPS surveys
representing planet textures, as opposed to sky surveys.  If the
\texttt{obs\_frame} property of a survey is set to the name of a planet or
other solar system body, Stellarium will render it in place of the default
texture used for the body.
